# LINKS that help me study operating system
1. [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)<br>
This Markdown cheat sheet provides a quick overview of all the Markdown syntax elements. This website is very useful for me, who easily forgets the syntax. 

2. [Open Vim](https://www.openvim.com/)<br/>
A brief interactive Vim (or vi) tutorial that teaches you the fundamental commands for navigating Vim. This website is also very useful for me, who just learn Vim.
